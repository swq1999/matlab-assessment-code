# KF5042 - Intelligent Systems MATLAB code
MATLAB code for the IEEE paper with the topic "Comparative Analysis of YOLov2, YOLOv3, and SSD for Human Detection in Surveillance Systems" as part of the Year 2 Intelligent Systems assessment at Northumbria University.

## How to Train the Model
- The "Pedestrains" folder is the dataset used for training and testing and should be inside the model folder (eg: v2Training) before running the main code.
- The main code filename for each model is as follows:

    | Model | Filename |
    | ---- | --- |
    | YOLOv2  | [YOLOv2.m](v2Training/YOLOv2.m) |
    | YOLOv3 | [v3.m](v3Training/v3.m) |
    | SSD  | [SSD.m](SSD/SSD.m) |
