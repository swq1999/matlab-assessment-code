# KF5042 - Intelligent Systems MATLAB code
MATLAB code for the IEEE paper as part of the Year 2 Intelligent Systems assessment at Northumbria University.

## How to Train/Test the Model
- The "[Pedestrians](Pedestrians)" folder is the dataset used for training/testing and should be placed inside the model folder before running the main code. (eg: v2Training/Pedestrians)
- The main code filename for each model is as follows:

    | Model | Filename |
    | ---- | --- |
    | YOLOv2  | [YOLOv2.m](v2Training/YOLOv2.m) |
    | YOLOv3 | [v3.m](v3Training/v3.m) |
    | SSD  | [SSD.m](SSD/SSD.m) |
